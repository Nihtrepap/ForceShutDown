# ForceShutDown
Simple shutdown program. 


Just why not.
Instead of opening for example cmd you open this program.

1. Input the minutes you want to be at your computer.

2. Press the "force shutdown" button.

3. You will now get a message that your computer will shutdown in "Input" minutes.

4. A green text appears to let you know the process is ongoing.

Now you wont be sitting for to long at your computer.

*******************************************************
You can't abort this inside the program.
The shutdown will not abort by closing the application
If you just want to test:
shutdown -a
Will abort the process if written inside cmd.
